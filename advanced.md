8\. **C# 9 and 10 Features**

   Illustrate how record types in C# 9/10 provide advantages over traditional class types.

   - [x] Records provide value-based equality and immutability which are ideal for data-centric models.

   - [ ] Records are faster than classes.

   - [ ] Records can have mutable properties.

   - [ ] There is no significant difference; it's just syntactic sugar.

9\. **Performance Optimization**

   How would you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in a .NET application?

   - [x] Use profiling tools, understand hot paths, and optimize algorithms and resource management.

   - [ ] Optimize every function regardless of its impact on overall performance.

   - [ ] Increase hardware capacity to improve performance.

   - [ ] Focus only on optimizing database queries.

10\. **Cross-Platform Development in .NET Core**

    Discuss the challenges and considerations when developing cross-platform applications in .NET Core.

    - [x] Handling different OS-specific features and paths, ensuring compatibility with different environments.

    - [ ] .NET Core applications are inherently cross-platform and require no additional considerations.

    - [ ] It's preferable to use .NET Framework for cross-platform needs.

    - [ ] .NET Core does not support true cross-platform development.

11\. **Advanced Async/Await Usage**

    Explain the concept of SynchronizationContext and its relevance in async/await programming.

    - [x] It maintains the context and helps in updating UI from the correct thread.

    - [ ] It's an outdated concept and has no use

 in modern async programming.

    - [ ] It's used to synchronize multiple tasks running in parallel.

    - [ ] It refers to the context where data synchronization happens.

12\. **Expression Trees**

    What are expression trees and how are they used in .NET?

    - [x] They represent code in a tree-like data structure and are used in LINQ and dynamic query generation.

    - [ ] They are used for XML parsing.

    - [ ] Expression trees are a visualization tool for debugging.

    - [ ] They are used for creating expressions in mathematics-based applications.

13\. **Unsafe Code and Pointers in C#**

    Discuss scenarios where unsafe code and pointers might be necessary in a C# application.

    - [x] For performance-critical applications requiring direct memory access, like graphics processing.

    - [ ] Unsafe code should be used regularly for better control over memory.

    - [ ] Pointers are not supported in C#.

    - [ ] Unsafe code is only used in unmanaged C++ interoperability.

14\. **Advanced Interoperability**

    Explain how to interoperate with unmanaged code in a C# application and potential pitfalls.

    - [x] Use P/Invoke, understanding marshaling and memory management concerns.

    - [ ] Interoperability should be avoided; rewrite unmanaged code in C#.

    - [ ] C# does not support interoperability with unmanaged code.

    - [ ] Directly access memory locations for interoperability.

15\. **Event Sourcing and CQRS**

    Describe Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and their benefits.

    - [x] Event sourcing maintains a log of changes; CQRS separates read and write operations, improving scalability and maintainability.

    - [ ] All services must be written in the same programming language.

    - [ ] Microservices are suitable only for small-scale applications.

17\. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

    - [x] It simplifies writing asynchronous and parallel code, efficiently managing threads.

    - [ ] It automatically parallelizes every task, eliminating the need for manual thread management.

    - [ ] They are automatically managed by .NET and don't need manual implementation.

    - [ ] Only use standard collections like List and Dictionary for simplicity.

20\. **Security Considerations in .NET**
